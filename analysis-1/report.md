This link was distributed through bot accounts with a message written in Russian, with the link attached. An example can be found [**here**](https://i.imgur.com/oiYpVWd.png).

After clicking on the link, you will be brought to a page which looks like [**this**](https://i.imgur.com/9ip2dBM.png). Up at the top, all of the buttons link to official Discord sites. However, the button under the Russian text (has to do with claiming Nitro) will open up a separate browser window which looks like [**this**](https://i.imgur.com/ySMBZPp.png).

From here, I thought it would be a normal Steam account stealer, but I was wrong. When I dumped the source of the website and found out it was actually a cryptocurrency miner! With the page open in the background, it mines cryptocurrencies and deposits them to an unknown wallet. While on the main page, you can see requests going out [**here**](https://i.imgur.com/JhcRaT8.png). These requests appear to be going to https://cryptophoenix.ltd/assets/be0060dafb7a0e31d2a1ca17c0708636.woff and contain normal things like system information.

As usual with most of the Steam account stealers, if you put in any details and click the login button it will send your credentials over to their server and display an error message that the account information was incorrect.
